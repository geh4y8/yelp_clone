YELP CLONE
===================================

This Ruby app allows users to create an account with a username and photo, upload photos of local restaurants and post reviews/ratings.

Install the program by cloning it, running bundle, creating a local database, and migrating the database.  A live version is running on Heroku, which you can check out [here](yelp-clone-epicodus.herokuapp.com/).
